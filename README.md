# Rainfall Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project exploring rainfall patterns and trends. The analysis utilizes Python for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain actionable insights from the dataset.

# Problem Statement
Rainfall plays a vital role in agriculture, water management, and planning in various regions. Accurately analyzing rainfall trends helps understand seasonal variations and long-term changes, enabling better decision-making for resource management.

This project aims to explore and analyze rainfall data, identify key patterns, and present meaningful visualizations to aid in decision-making processes.

# Data Collection
The dataset includes historical rainfall data with multiple attributes representing daily, monthly, or annual rainfall metrics. It consists of thousands of entries, with columns such as:
- Year: The year of measurement.
- Month: The month of measurement.
- Rainfall Amount: The measured rainfall (in mm or cm).

# Data Preprocessing
The dataset required preprocessing to handle:

- Missing Values: Imputed using statistical techniques like mean, median, or advanced methods like K-Nearest Neighbors imputation.
- Outliers: Detected and handled to ensure robust analysis.
- Feature Scaling: Applied for uniformity in analysis and visualization.
- Data Encoding: Handled categorical variables if present.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Comprehensive EDA was performed to uncover:
- Seasonal and yearly trends.
- Correlations between rainfall and other features.
- Distribution and anomalies in rainfall data.

EDA was visualized using plots such as:
- Line plots for trends.
- Box plots for detecting anomalies.
- Heatmaps for feature correlations.
